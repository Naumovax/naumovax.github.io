  "articleBody": "not a technical post Intro to post I’ve been writing tasks for CTF for three years now. At first, it was mostly ucucuga, but after failures - interesting thoughts and ideas come with experience, which later results in beautiful interesting tasks. I wrote tasks of different categories - crypto, network, reverse, misk… but today I want to show you the double osint task which I used on Dubna summer school for students of the NRU MPEI. What is so unusual about this task that I decided to dedicate this post to it? Now you will see because we will have to plunge first into 2018 and then into 1994 altogether. Intro to osint What is osint for you? Wikipedia says: Osint is the collection and analysis of data gathered from open sources (overt and publicly available sources) to produce actionable intelligence. It’s really. When I write osint tasks on CTF, my main goal is to show how extensive the Internet is and its capabilities, how much information can be discovered with a couple of clicks. I want not only to teach some search methods or new tools (the number of which has long exceeded a thousand), I want to make the time spent on solving the task interesting. It’s not a secret that osint tasks are taken by the guys because osint is considered an easy and weak category - of course, it’s sad. When I solve tasks of this category on other CTFs, I try to make it for myself - to find interesting information, new sources and tools, and not just get the coveted 1000 (any number) points.\nAnyway, the most amazing feeling you get when you write tasks yourself, come up with an idea, a concept, think through possible steps of players, test hypotheses. Well… what about the task? The double task is so-called because it consists of two parts (it was created on 01.07.21). First part:\nThe head of the security service of a very popular social network posted an interesting document in the not yet covid year, which turned out to be in second place in terms of the number of retweets (oh, it seems to be a hint). But we are interested in the content of the document. The document states that the defendants financed the rental of a virtual private server registered with a certain email account. You just need to specify this email.\nSecond part:\nDo you want to plunge into the turbulent life of the hacker group, of which our head of the security service from task above was a member? I think so. Then you will have to teleport to the origins of the Internet during the youth of your parents and find in the notes of hackers of this group, in which hotel the hackers settled when they went to one hacker conference held in their last 5th year. Hint: usually notes are made in a personal or shared team blog\nTo solve the first part, you need to carefully read the terms. We see the word “retweet” - then we find the head of the security service - at the time of 01.07.21 it was Peiter Zatko (21.01.22 there was news, that he was leaving the post of head of security). “in the not yet covid year” - we understand that the search will be from 2020 and earlier. “in second place by the number of retweets” - we will sort when we narrow down the sample.\n We found Peiter’s Twitter account - @dotMudge First, we slightly changed the number of retweets to find the optimal number, as a result, our request is ready:  (from:dotMudge) AND min_retweets:700 until:2020-12-31\nWe saw the second tweet (“in second place by the number of retweets”)   and clicked on the link in the tweet.\nThis is the “Special Counsel Indication” document on the accusation of interference in the elections with the help of the computer technology of several Russian hackers. On page 13, in paragraph 35, we see the required response-a flag “the Conspirators also used to fund the lease of a virtual private server registered with the operational email account dirbinsaabol@mai1.com”   Follow the hacker group (back to the 20th century) One careful reading will not be enough. Bit by bit we will collect the missing pieces of the puzzle. Wikipedia will give us answers about Peiter’s hacker group - L0pht Heavy Industries. For the most curious - you can read about the history of the origin, members, Senate testimony, products. Well, we will move to study the site (for full immersion, we will choose the very first snapshot 00:56:07 NOVEMBER 9, 1996, although you can look at later ones - there are a lot of interesting things there) - in Wayback Machine. I won’t stop you - read, study the website. For example, you can see the funny photo with guys in a bar (in addition to documentation, tools and other cool features): When finally you get to the archives page - there your attention will be attracted by Cult of the Dead Cow. The inscription on the next page reads:\nSo.... One way or another, you've found us... Followed the digital hoofmarks to the big green pasture in this Techno Wasteland....\nAt some point in time (in 5 seconds or the day after tomorrow) we will see HoHoCon'94 out of the corner of our eye. I think if a seasoned researcher is reading this article now, he will easily remember what it is about - I have never heard of HoHoCon before due to age and maybe lack of curiosity. It seems that we completely forgot about the wording of the second part of the task - and it just talks about some kind of conference (“which hotel did the hackers stay in when they went to one hacker conference held in their last 5th year”). What a coincidence (I took you along a long route, this is not a right-tap, but a study)! The last click and here is the same post/page/note, which talks about the trip of Loft participants to the HoHoCon'94 conference. Maybe because I really like to read this type of story, maybe because I occasionally write such stories myself - I really enjoyed reading this story and others (on the Loft website). The notes are not very informative, it’s true. Hackers write about their ordinary life - a trip to another city, meeting friends, drinking, the next day of the conference, when you want to sleep, then again a stormy evening, a change of hotel, sadness from returning home… In the end, you already forget what you had to find the answer to solve the task (oh yes, the flag is the Ramada hotel).\nThere were many funny moments in the story, but I would like to highlight the following separately:\nThe new laws define \"approaching\" a restricted computer system as being illegal, as well as defining a \"biochemical computational device\" as a computer system. In other words, if someone comes up to you and talks to you, they have \"approached\" your personal \"biochemical computational device\" (read: brain), and are technically prosecutable for \"hacking\" under Texas law. Some words about HoHoCon My favorite (I shouldn’t love it!) free encyclopedia gives a summary of the conference HoHoCon (also XmasCon). It is indicated that she was one of the first, and also served as inspiration for the creation of DEFCON and HOPE. HoHoCon passed for 5 years from 1990 to 1994 for everyone related to the computer underground. Discovery While I was searching for interesting information for my post - I came across a magazine Phrack Inc. Philes, which to this day uploads cyber articles and notes of researchers and hackers. For another half a day I was stuck in textfiles.com, namely the sections /hacking, /phreak and /magazines. Conclusion Perhaps this little dive into the hacker notes of the web archive was close to me because of personal experience - a lot of conferences and events that I have traveled to for the past 4 years. Unfortunately, covid has also affected this part of my life - a lot of conferences have started to be held online, it’s terrible! But I don’t want to end this post on a sad note.\nSo it’s cool that web archives exist, it’s cool that you can look back 30 years and visit some kind of Christmas conference for hackers. ",

For the most curious - you can read about the history of the origin, members, Senate testimony, products. Well, we will move to study the site (for full immersion, we will choose the very first snapshot 00:56:07 NOVEMBER 9, 1996, although you can look at later ones - there are a lot of interesting things there) - in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19961222055850/http://l0pht.com/">Wayback Machine</a>. I won&rsquo;t stop you - read, study the website. For example, you can see the funny photo with guys in a bar (in addition to documentation, tools and other cool features):

<p>When finally you get to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19961109005858/http://l0pht.com/archives.html">the archives page</a> - there your attention will be attracted by <strong>Cult of the Dead Cow</strong>.

</p>
<p>The inscription on the next page reads:</p>
<p><code>So.... One way or another, you've found us... Followed the digital hoofmarks to the big green pasture in this Techno Wasteland....</code></p>
<p>At some point in time (in 5 seconds or the day after tomorrow) we will see HoHoCon'94 out of the corner of our eye. I think if a seasoned researcher is reading this article now, he will easily remember what it is about - I have never heard of HoHoCon before due to age and maybe lack of curiosity. It seems that we completely forgot about the wording of the second part of the task - and it just talks about some kind of conference (&ldquo;which hotel did the hackers stay in when they went to one hacker conference held in their last 5th year&rdquo;). What a coincidence (I took you along a long route, this is not a right-tap, but a study)! The last click and here is the same <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19970608232505/http://www.l0pht.com/~veggie/HoHo94.html">post/page/note</a>, which talks about the trip of Loft participants to the HoHoCon'94 conference.

</p>
<p>Maybe because I really like to read this type of story, maybe because I occasionally write such stories myself - I really enjoyed reading this story and others (on the Loft website). The notes are not very informative, it&rsquo;s true. Hackers write about their ordinary life - a trip to another city, meeting friends, drinking, the next day of the conference, when you want to sleep, then again a stormy evening, a change of hotel, sadness from returning home&hellip; In the end, you already forget what you had to find the answer to solve the task (oh yes, the flag is the Ramada hotel).</p>
<p><em>There were many funny moments in the story, but I would like to highlight the following separately:</em></p>
<p><code>The new laws define &quot;approaching&quot; a restricted computer system as being illegal, as well as defining a &quot;biochemical computational device&quot; as a computer system. In other words, if someone comes up to you and talks to you, they have &quot;approached&quot; your personal &quot;biochemical computational device&quot; (read: brain), and are technically prosecutable for &quot;hacking&quot; under Texas law.</code>

<h2 id="some-words-about-hohocon">Some words about HoHoCon<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#some-words-about-hohocon">#</a></h2>
<p>My favorite (I shouldn&rsquo;t love it!) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HoHoCon">free encyclopedia</a> gives a summary of the conference HoHoCon (also XmasCon). It is indicated that she was one of the first, and also served as inspiration for the creation of DEFCON and HOPE. HoHoCon passed for 5 years from 1990 to 1994 for everyone related to the computer underground.

<h2 id="discovery">Discovery<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#discovery">#</a></h2>
<p>While I was searching for interesting information for my post - I came across a magazine <a href="http://phrack.org/issues/1/1.html">Phrack Inc. Philes</a>, which to this day uploads cyber articles and notes of researchers and hackers.
<img loading="lazy" src="/hohocon94/6.png" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>For another half a day I was stuck in <a href="http://textfiles.com/">textfiles.com</a>, namely the sections /hacking, /phreak and /magazines.

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>Perhaps this little dive into the hacker notes of the web archive was close to me because of personal experience - a lot of conferences and events that I have traveled to for the past 4 years. Unfortunately, covid has also affected this part of my life - a lot of conferences have started to be held online, it&rsquo;s terrible! But I don&rsquo;t want to end this post on a sad note.</p>
<p>So <strong>it&rsquo;s cool that web archives exist, it&rsquo;s cool that you can look back 30 years and visit some kind of Christmas conference for hackers</strong>.
