In the spring of the same year, the guys invited me to their new two-month course (internship) on Advanced osint. And so began the story of one post, one of the thousands of attacks.\nIn this note, I will tell you about my mini-research (that I did as part of the internship) related to a fairly well-known attack that occurred on July 2, 2021. You will ask me: “Oh, the Kaseya research, have you found the Revils themselves?” No, of course not! (laughing) I restored the chronology of the events of that and subsequent days, as well as the chain of circumstances that influenced the attack. Intro to cyberattack On Friday, July 2, 2021, Kaseya, makers of popular IT software used by managed service providers (MSPs), was recently affected by a REvil ransomware attack. REvil ransomware operators used zero-day vulnerabilities to deliver a malicious update, compromising fewer than 60 Kaseya customers and 1,500 downstream companies.\nKaseya VSA is a centralized IT management software for enterprises. It is divided into a control terminal and a client terminal. The control terminal can control client devices in batch mode, such as execute commands, execute scripts, and power on/off the client devices. According to the official announcement and the ransom incident that REvil uses to exploit VSA vulnerabilities, there are several major vulnerabilities in the VSA software. Attackers can use these vulnerabilities to bypass authentication and direct control of the VSA control terminal, as well as to further control slave devices through the control terminal.\nBelow I will consider the infrastructure of the company and the attackers, analyze why the attack took place and who was the primary source of the Internet news. Infrastructure of Kaseya In the first step, I found the company’s website kaseya.com In the Maltego web application, I did a search by site domain. The screenshot below shows the dependency graph. On the graph, I see many subdomains, 3 companies, phone numbers, dns servers and geolocation. An interesting fact is that the company’s corporate mail is Outlook. Next, it’s interesting to explore the website. Creation Date: 1999-12-06T18:53:56Z Email, social media domains and other resources posted on the analyzed website are visible again. But now I see also IP 34.136.151.236 – it is the last IP to which kaseya.com was attached. In researching IP I see all domains on it… I found a copy - staging wp engine for kaseya.com - is kaseyastaging.wpengine.com\nIt is a staging site that allows you to test any changes or important new features that are planned to be implemented in a secure environment. Developers typically use staging sites to test changes and fix bugs before going into production.\nNow Kaseya has 6 products which it sells to many different companies. But I’m interested in Kaseya Virtual System Administrator. Kaseya VSA is remote monitoring and management for all IT functions integrated in a single console). Why this particular product? Because REvil hacked it in order to inject ransomware into the computer systems of companies and organizations around the world. The product is described in the «How did they hack Kaseya?» topic below. How did they hack Kaseya? The following information was found in news sources:\nIn April 2021, specialists from the Dutch non-profit organization DIVD (Dutch Institute for Vulnerability Disclosure) privately reported to Kaseya about 7 vulnerabilities in a VSA product. 4 vulnerabilities were fixed in the spring with the release of security updates, and the remaining three were supposed to be fixed in the next version - VSA 9.5.7. REvil managed to exploit an unpatched vulnerability (CVE-2021-30116) before the patch was released.\nLet’s go find info about patches of this product. On official site of Kaseya: How I see - 9 days after the attack developers fixed as many as 3 vulnerabilities: Some “screen-words” about CVE-2021-30116: This vuln was discovered by Wietse Boonstra from Dutch Institute for Vulnerability Disclosure.\nCVE has 3 subtypes.\n1.1 CVE-2021-30116: VSA SQL injection vulnerability\nVulnerability Type: SQL Injection; Code Execution\nImpact: Server take over\nBrief description: There are many SQL injection vulnerabilities in the VSA management program endpoint, which is located in userFilterTableRpt.asp, Through the connected SQL Server attacker, you can execute the system command and .NET code by performing malicious query statements.\n1.2 CVE-2021-30116: VSA authentication bypass vulnerability\nVulnerability Type: Code Execution\nImpact: Around the authentication limit using the function of the service; server take over\nBrief description: There is an authentication around the vulnerability in the Endpoint of the VSA management program.dl.asp Routing and can be used in combination with other path functions under the route.\n1.3 CVE-2021-30116: VSA file upload vulnerability\nVulnerability type: file upload\nImpact: Upload malicious documents to the server; server take over\nBrief description: There is an arbitrary file on the Endpoint of the VSA management program. This vulnerability is located KUpload.dll The cause of this upload vulnerability is the combination of normal upload functions and authentication vulnerabilities, resulting in an attacker to take this capture system. Infrastructure of REvil The goal is to find some info about the infrastructure of hack group REvil which is associated with Kaseya. There are many web resources that write about Happy Blog, but all users and vendors hide (paint over) url in the address bar. But I’m interested to find in DarkNet this “Happy Blog”! There are many different search options, but I decided to start with telegram. This is a resource in the depths of which you can find a lot of useful information. I entered “Happy Blog revil” and found a strange Telegram channel, the owner of which claims to be the channel of the Revil group. There is no reason to trust this information, as the channel may be hosted by followers or hacker fans. Well, now in such a funny way I found the alleged onion Revil site. The first step is to test the functionality. But, alas, the site is not available. To verify the validity of the site, I go to Google and make sure that the site is indeed the property of the Revil group. The next hypothesis is that the site has changed, I googled “revil[.]onion” for the last month and look at the pictures. Result:\n18 hours ago @_IntelligenceX tweeted a few posts about the group's site, stating that \"#REvil's site went dark\". And on intelx.io the snapshot of page with info about Kaseya hack: xakep.ru indicated that the entire infrastructure of the group was shut down.\nRegarding the other infrastructure of Revil, I found information about the URLs through which negotiations with Revil were conducted from the user @resecurity_com on Twitter. Interestingly, the attackers' domain belongs to Russian ISP/cloud hosting company. But I want to see the site of Revil with payment info. In video twit I see it: Monero address where to send money and chat with hackers: Also I found a beautiful visual graph about Kaseya attack info: At tria.ge I see the sample of ransomware exe. MD5: 94d087166651c0020a9e6cc2fdacdc0c (and 561cffbaba71a6e8cc1cdceda990ead4)\nSituation on VirusTotal is good: Also: Huntress Security Researcher Caleb Stewart has successfully reproduced attack and released a POC video demonstrating the chain of exploits: Exploit pocs are in two youtube videos: 1 and 2.\nIn conclusion of this topic, it is worth noting that with the help of a regular osint search, many iocs related to the Revil group were found. But at the time of July 13, the hackers removed their infrastructure and went into the shadows. It is noteworthy that it was on July 13 that the payment deadline was due, the amount should be doubled. News (how it all began) First step I decided to search some news in twitter by:\n\"Kaseya\" AND \"attack\" until:2021-07-03 since:2021-07-01\nAnd I found this twit: But if you expand your search for the word Kaseya, you can see news from an earlier time (the earliest found from user @natetimberlake who complains that he cannot get through). Below in the comments of this post, users threw off the Reddit url with a discussion of the problem. On Reddit users actively began to discuss the problem even before it reached Twitter. This post was created by user ChargeTechnical7885. In the comments, users of many companies actively discussed how their MSPs became unavailable and that more and more computers were infected every hour, someone wrote about their assumptions of vulnerabilities.\nKaseya is created discussion:\nhelpdesk.kaseya.com/hc/en-gb/articles/4403440684689  On 4:00 pm EDT. While users created a discussion in soc networks earlier at 1:30 pm (*attention - the screenshots indicate Moscow time == edt+7).  And researcher Mark created twit at 2:54 pm: Further, the news was successfully picked up by all IT-Internet communities. Сonclusion An osint research was carried out to find infrastructure, vulnerabilities, news and other information related to the Kaseya attack. Interesting sources and iocs were found, and the chronology of the attack was also described (how it began, continued, what is the result, how it ended).\nWhat did I want to show with this mini-research?\nFirstly, if you are interested, you can get to the bottom of it using the basic tools of Google. No, it’s not difficult, but it takes time and desire. Secondly, almost all serious attacks are tied to uncovered vulnerabilities. It seems like I’m writing banal things, you say, but whole corporations are losing a bunch of zeros and ones on such banal things (in monetary and binary equivalents). Just one of a bunch of cyberattacks in 2021 - but it would be possible to investigate others (who knows what my next post will be about).\n",

<p>One winter in 2021, I met some cool guys from the Indian company <a href="https://www.bluefire-redteam.com/">Bluefire Redteam</a> and wrote osint tasks for their CTF. In the spring of the same year, the guys invited me to their new two-month course (internship) on Advanced osint. And so began the story of one post, one of the thousands of attacks.</p>
<p>In this note, I will tell you about my mini-research (that I did as part of the internship) related to a fairly well-known attack that occurred on July 2, 2021.

<p>Now Kaseya has 6 products which it sells to many different companies. But I’m interested in Kaseya Virtual System Administrator. Kaseya VSA is remote monitoring and management for all IT functions integrated in a single console).
<img loading="lazy" src="/kaseya-pngs/5.png" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>Why this particular product? Because REvil hacked it in order to inject ransomware into the computer systems of companies and organizations around the world. The product is described in the <em>«How did they hack Kaseya?»</em> topic below.

<p><em>The following information was found in news sources:</em></p>
<p>In April 2021, specialists from the Dutch non-profit organization DIVD (Dutch Institute for Vulnerability Disclosure) privately reported to Kaseya about <strong>7 vulnerabilities in a VSA product</strong>. 
<img loading="lazy" src="/kaseya-pngs/6.png" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>4 vulnerabilities were fixed in the spring with the release of security updates, and the remaining three were supposed to be fixed in the next version - <strong>VSA 9.5.7</strong>. REvil managed to exploit an unpatched vulnerability (<strong>CVE-2021-30116</strong>) before the patch was released.</p>
<p>Let’s go find info about patches of this product. On official site of Kaseya:
<img loading="lazy" src="/kaseya-pngs/7.png" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>How I see - 9 days after the attack developers fixed as many as 3 vulnerabilities:

</p>
<p>Some “screen-words” about CVE-2021-30116:
<img loading="lazy" src="/kaseya-pngs/9.png" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>This vuln was discovered by <strong>Wietse Boonstra</strong> from Dutch Institute for Vulnerability Disclosure.</p>
<p>CVE has 3 subtypes.</p>
<p><em><strong>1.1 CVE-2021-30116: VSA SQL injection vulnerability</strong></em></p>
<p>Vulnerability Type: SQL Injection; Code Execution</p>
<p>Impact: Server take over</p>
<p>Brief description: There are many SQL injection vulnerabilities in the VSA management program endpoint, which is located in userFilterTableRpt.asp, Through the connected SQL Server attacker, you can execute the system command and .NET code by performing malicious query statements.</p>
<p><em><strong>1.2 CVE-2021-30116: VSA authentication bypass vulnerability</strong></em></p>
<p>Vulnerability Type: Code Execution</p>
<p>Impact: Around the authentication limit using the function of the service; server take over</p>
<p>Brief description: There is an authentication around the vulnerability in the Endpoint of the VSA management program.dl.asp Routing and can be used in combination with other path functions under the route.</p>
<p><em><strong>1.3 CVE-2021-30116: VSA file upload vulnerability</strong></em></p>
<p>Vulnerability type: file upload</p>
<p>Impact: Upload malicious documents to the server; server take over</p>
<p>Brief description: There is an arbitrary file on the Endpoint of the VSA management program. This vulnerability is located KUpload.dll The cause of this upload vulnerability is the combination of normal upload functions and authentication vulnerabilities, resulting in an attacker to take this capture system.

<h2 id="infrastructure-of-revil">Infrastructure of REvil<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#infrastructure-of-revil">#</a></h2>
<p>The goal is to find some info about the infrastructure of hack group REvil which is associated with Kaseya. There are many web resources that write about Happy Blog, but all users and vendors hide (paint over) url in the address bar. But I’m interested to find in DarkNet this “Happy Blog”!
<img loading="lazy" src="/kaseya-pngs/10.png" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>There are many different search options, but I decided to start with telegram. This is a resource in the depths of which you can find a lot of useful information. I entered &ldquo;Happy Blog revil&rdquo; and found a strange Telegram channel, the owner of which claims to be the channel of the Revil group. There is no reason to trust this information, as the channel may be hosted by followers or hacker fans.
<img loading="lazy" src="/kaseya-pngs/11.png" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>Well, now in such a funny way I found the alleged onion Revil site. The first step is to test the functionality. But, alas, the site is not available. To verify the validity of the site, I go to Google and make sure that the site is indeed the property of the Revil group.
<img loading="lazy" src="/kaseya-pngs/12.png" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>The next hypothesis is that the site has changed, I googled &ldquo;revil[.]onion&rdquo; for the last month and look at the pictures. Result:</p>
<p><code>18 hours ago @_IntelligenceX tweeted a few posts about the group's site, stating that &quot;#REvil's site went dark&quot;.</code>
<img loading="lazy" src="/kaseya-pngs/13.png" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>And on <a href="https://intelx.io/?did=99ae55f8-4f3c-4d8c-9508-f4decad3c186">intelx.io</a> the snapshot of page with info about Kaseya hack:
<img loading="lazy" src="/kaseya-pngs/14.png" alt=""  />
</p>
<p><a href="https://xakep.ru/2021/07/13/revil-down/">xakep.ru</a> indicated that the entire infrastructure of the group was shut down.</p>
<p>Regarding the other infrastructure of Revil, I found information about the URLs through which negotiations with Revil were conducted from the user <strong>@resecurity_com</strong> on Twitter.
<img loading="lazy" src="/kaseya-pngs/15.png" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>Interestingly, the attackers' domain belongs to Russian ISP/cloud hosting company. But I want to see the site of Revil with payment info. In <a href="https://twitter.com/resecurity_com/status/1413184513396510722">video twit</a> I see it:
<img loading="lazy" src="/kaseya-pngs/16.png" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>Monero address where to send money and chat with hackers:
<img loading="lazy" src="/kaseya-pngs/17.png" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>Also I found a beautiful visual graph about Kaseya attack info:
<img loading="lazy" src="/kaseya-pngs/18.png" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>At <a href="https://tria.ge/210703-cggr9ffskx">tria.ge</a> I see the sample of ransomware exe.

<p>MD5: <strong>94d087166651c0020a9e6cc2fdacdc0c</strong> (and <strong>561cffbaba71a6e8cc1cdceda990ead4</strong>)</p>
<p>Situation on VirusTotal is good:
<img loading="lazy" src="/kaseya-pngs/20.png" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>Also:
<img loading="lazy" src="/kaseya-pngs/21.png" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>Huntress Security Researcher <strong>Caleb Stewart</strong> has successfully reproduced attack and released a POC video demonstrating the chain of exploits:
<img loading="lazy" src="/kaseya-pngs/22.png" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>Exploit pocs are in two youtube videos: <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6E2X35spjwk">1</a> and <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=dK4kvZ7n4eM">2</a>.</p>
<p><em>In conclusion of this topic, it is worth noting that with the help of a regular osint search, many iocs related to the Revil group were found. But at the time of July 13, the hackers removed their infrastructure and went into the shadows. It is noteworthy that it was on July 13 that the payment deadline was due, the amount should be doubled.</em>

<h2 id="news-how-it-all-began">News (how it all began)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#news-how-it-all-began">#</a></h2>
<p>First step I decided to search some news in twitter by:</p>
<p><code>&quot;Kaseya&quot; AND &quot;attack&quot; until:2021-07-03 since:2021-07-01</code></p>
<p>And I found this twit:
<img loading="lazy" src="/kaseya-pngs/23.png" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>But if you expand your search for the word Kaseya, you can see news from an earlier time (the earliest found from user <strong>@natetimberlake</strong> who complains that he cannot get through). Below in the comments of this post, users threw off the Reddit url with a discussion of the problem. On Reddit users actively began to discuss the problem even before it reached Twitter.
<img loading="lazy" src="/kaseya-pngs/24.png" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>This post was created by user <strong>ChargeTechnical7885</strong>. In the comments, users of many companies actively discussed how their MSPs became unavailable and that more and more computers were infected every hour, someone wrote about their assumptions of vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Kaseya is created discussion:</p>
<p><code>helpdesk.kaseya.com/hc/en-gb/articles/4403440684689</code>
<img loading="lazy" src="/kaseya-pngs/25.png" alt=""  />
</p>
<ul>
<li>On <strong>4:00 pm</strong> EDT. While users created a discussion in soc networks earlier</li>
<li>at <strong>1:30 pm</strong> (*attention - the screenshots indicate Moscow time == edt+7).</li>
</ul>
<p>And researcher Mark created twit at <strong>2:54 pm</strong>:
<img loading="lazy" src="/kaseya-pngs/26.png" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>Further, the news was successfully picked up by all IT-Internet communities.

<h2 id="сonclusion">Сonclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#сonclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>An osint research was carried out to find infrastructure, vulnerabilities, news and other information related to the Kaseya attack. Interesting sources and iocs were found, and the chronology of the attack was also described (how it began, continued, what is the result, how it ended).</p>
<p><strong>What did I want to show with this mini-research?</strong></p>
<p>Firstly, if you are interested, you can get to the bottom of it using the basic tools of Google. No, it&rsquo;s not difficult, but it takes time and desire.
Secondly, almost all serious attacks are tied to uncovered vulnerabilities. It seems like I&rsquo;m writing banal things, you say, but whole corporations are losing a bunch of zeros and ones on such banal things (in monetary and binary equivalents).
Just one of a bunch of cyberattacks in 2021 - but it would be possible to investigate others (who knows what my next post will be about).</p>
