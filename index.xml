      <description>this research was completed by July 16, 2021 Intro to post One winter in 2021, I met some cool guys from the Indian company Bluefire Redteam and wrote osint tasks for their CTF. In the spring of the same year, the guys invited me to their new two-month course (internship) on Advanced osint. And so began the story of one post, one of the thousands of attacks.
In this note, I will tell you about my mini-research (that I did as part of the internship) related to a fairly well-known attack that occurred on July 2, 2021.</description>

      <description>About me (cybersecurity) In 2018, I got into the world of cybersecurity thanks to enrolling in MPEI university, or rather, the CTF movement held at a university. Now I am a member of the &amp;ldquo;Unicorn Team&amp;rdquo; (university CTF team). I like to solve osint, cryptography, network, sometimes web, forensics. I worked for 2 years at Kaspersky Lab as a web threat analyst. More than once I won or became a prize-winner in various competitions related to cybersecurity.</description>
