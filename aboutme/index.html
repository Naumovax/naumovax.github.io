<p>In 2018, I got into the world of cybersecurity thanks to enrolling in MPEI university, or rather, the CTF movement held at a university. Now I am a member of the &ldquo;Unicorn Team&rdquo; (university CTF team). I like to solve osint, cryptography, network, sometimes web, forensics. I worked for 2 years at Kaspersky Lab as a web threat analyst. More than once I won or became a prize-winner in various competitions related to cybersecurity.
